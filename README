- Sweclockers Dark Theme -
--------------------------

This is a theme created by a member (me, Blargmode) of sweclockers.com. This theme is not requested by the owners of sweclockers and is not in any way official. It's just a user-theme.

Here's the forum post(Swedish): http://www.sweclockers.com/forum/10-programmering-och-digitalt-skapande/1089561-ett-morkt-tema-till-sweclockers/

Since the start of the project other users has joined in.
As of this update the "crew" (sounds cool right?) looks like this:

_/Crew\_________________________
Blargmode	- Creator and coder

_______/Others\_________________
There has also been some minor contributions by others and I'm very grateful.
Thanks for the support guys!
